# Santander Customer Transaction Prediction
### Can you identify who will make a transaction?

In this challenge, we invite Kagglers to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem.

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.
